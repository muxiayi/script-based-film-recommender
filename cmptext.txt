I'm not Beth.
I'm not Beth.
I'm not Beth.
Shh.
Why would one of us be killing us? What is wrong with her? Bad breath.
Bat shit crazy.
Does she know about me? About my kids? How do you know you didn't just bring her right to my doorstep? Because she's impaled with rebar and I wouldn't do that.
I have been living this nightmare much longer than you have, Sarah.
I explained.
I have a family to protect.
I do what I can.
Right.
You provide financially.
Yeah, so you wanted that money Beth was holding.
Your self-defense fund.
You're right, I was gonna steal it and run, but I can't do that, because I have a family too, Alison.
My daughter.
- Your daughter? - Yeah.
Her name's Kira.
And I meant to be seeing her today, but there's this killer up my ass, so Wait, is she your biological child or adopted like mine? Mine.
Why? Don't you think you should have told us about that before? Er, why would I do that? I'm telling you now because we have to deal with this.
Yeah? Beth was on this killer's hit list and now I am.
Well what am I supposed to do about it? How can I help? Be available.
I may need you somehow.
Wow, rich, man! This looks like a new blade inset in a much older handle.
So the fish is a bitch.
Symbiotically speaking, like a universal way back symbol of fecundity.
But these wings though, they're Seriously, what is she on about? Quiet, she's just weird.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay, going on a tangent there.
If she's not dead, we need to find her.
Find out what she knows.
Are you mad? She's a homicidal maniac.
But we need to find out who she is, Sarah.
She's She found us, she's got answers.
The only way I'm gonna do that is go back to being a cop.
No.
No way, you're not going back to being Beth.
Impersonating a dead officer, that's like a whole new crime.
I think I'm safest with the cops, to be honest with you.
Did that actually just come out of your mouth? Look.
Art's already looking for the killer.
I shadow him as Beth, I let them figure out what has happened to her and when I find out I can jump off and deal.
Deal? I'm beginning to realize crazy is genetic.
Well, yeah, bad brain chemistry can be genetic.
Um, but environment, that's individual, right? I mean, that's the whole nature-nurture question right there.
Okay, let's talk nature.
Out of nine so far, one's a psycho who killed four others.
One committed suicide, one is a bloody soccer mum, and then there's you.
My crazy sister is sane by comparison.
Thanks, Fe I think this might help us figure out where she's coming from.
So I'll look into it.
Ah, police business.
Art's got a lead.
Okay! Hey you didn't show this to Alison by any chance, did you? You joking? She'd crap her Lululemon.
Got Alison on standby.
Make sure Jimbo wears his seat belt.
You're sending the kids to your parents on a school morning.
Well, they're staying the night.
That's not an answer.
Well, you didn't pose it as a question, did you, Donnie? Okay, why? Why did you cancel all their activities? I just need some time to myself.
You have your usual Thursday night drinks with clients, right? Yes.
So I'll see you when you come crashing in at 3:00 a.
m.
, now, won't I? I don't crash in One time.
Oh crap! Sorry.
I'm jumpy too.
How's your head? Probably about the same as yours.
It's a good day to be alive, Beth.
My kids thank you, even my ex thanks you.
- Yeah, don't mention it.
- I didn't, they did.
I got a present for you.
Our killer made a pit stop.
That's his bike.
- They got him? - No, but we got a witness.
Just follow the bloody brick road.
Hey, there he is, our walking wounded.
You all good, Art? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, glad you're okay.
We're gonna get this guy.
Don't worry, all right? So your guy wore gloves, no prints, but he has not exactly covered his tracks.
Go take a look.
Self-surgery.
The guy is what? Military? Looks like it's gotta hurt.
Oh, and the witness is ready.
- Art, you wanna take him? - No.
Come on.
I slept through the whole thing.
I can't believe I did.
Trevor came into my room and it was dark, and he was all wet With blood.
He said it was an angry angel.
Hey, Trevor.
Can you tell me what the angry angel looked like? Beth? The person in your bathroom, was a woman? Is that possible? Let me talk to him.
Yeah, sure.
It's okay, darling.
I'm not her.
She said you would come.
Pick a color.
Red.
R- E-D.
Pick one.
That one.
Wait, let me see that.
- Can I keep this? - Yes.
What you got there? Souvenir.
What the hell? Hey, can you bag this? It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.
Yes, once again 8:00, before her bedtime.
- Is that my mum? - No.
Did you just tell her it wasn't me? Sarah, why are you calling? If you don't show after all this anticipation Just making sure we're still on.
Well, we are at this end.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Can I talk to her? You can talk to her tonight.
If you let her down, that's it.
I won't let you see her again.
I said I'll be there.
So you all have copies of the fortune teller.
Eye witness says we got it wrong.
Jane Doe's killer is female.
About Beth's size.
As for the Jane Doe, it isn't easy reconstructing a skull that's gone through a gravel crusher, but, we do have cause of death.
This hole.
223 caliber.
So, we have a long range, high-powered weapon.
Name me one homicide ever pinned on a female sniper.
How's our profile? Female killers tend to suffer from chronic detachment, isolation breeds sociopaths.
This song, "Fearfully and wonderfully made.
" She's a religious fanatic.
The stick figures, the doll's head, the fortune teller Early childhood development issues, could be extreme abuse.
Yes, but she's also careful in her way.
No prints on any of this so far.
And the DNA evidence? On rush, but we're still a week away from knowing if they match anyone on file.
Nothing on Jane Doe's prints? Her hand didn't give us a match? No, no.
It did not.
Look, the bottom line is we're chasing a calculated female killer who loves playing games.
Like these fortune tellers.
Angie Certain choices, give certain answers.
Every choice is a different death, could be threats, could be existing kills, they might mean something when combined with the numbers.
Childs? Childs? Call for you.
- Detective Childs - No, you're not.
Beth is dead, isn't she? What do you want from me? You could have killed me, but here we are.
- You didn't feel it? - What? We have a connection.
Er, you mean when I stuck that piece of rebar in your liver? How's that going? I need to know who you are.
Let's meet again.
I never got your name.
I never got yours.
Helena.
And last name? You're doing police work but how long can that last? When the real police find me you are me and I'm you.
We're both the victim and the cop.
Yeah, that would be bad for both of us.
So come see me, discuss I already gave you directions.
Hey, come here.
The numbers, they're addresses.
Okay, 17 is the street number of the quarry where we found Jane Doe.
Yeah, the rooming house.
Shooting scene.
The kid's house.
Even the precinct.
Everywhere we've been.
Except one.
one address with that street number, from the kid's house, Lake Point Road.
Oh, I know that place.
Lot of squatters around there.
- Let's check it out.
- Hold it.
Wait for emergency tactical, huh? This is a probable sniper, so let 'em sweep it first before you go in.
Got it? Hey, don't worry.
Let's do this.
I'm parked over here so No, no, no, after last night, we stick together, come on.
Whoa, Beth! Rough night? Okie-doke then.
Out.
What? Anybody else feel like they have a target on their back? - All clear.
- Copy.
Okay, I'll take you guys in for a closer look.
You're gonna love it.
Over here, detectives.
Looks like more self-surgery.
Can't be long till she bleeds out.
Holy shit! It's the same figures as the fortune teller.
She's saying she's a serial killer? Could be her single victim.
Our Jane Doe, over and over again? Or she just draws like a third grader.
Is this her? Or her next victim.
Next victim.
Detective Childs.
Hey, it's me.
- Paul? - Oh! - Hello, Paul.
- How are you doing? Oh, not too good.
- I got beat up.
- What? - What happened? - Please come and get me out of here.
She led us here.
She wanted us to see this.
Maybe a wild goose chase.
Wasting our time.
No.
She had a reason.
Okay, let's let forensics have this.
I hope you don't have dinner plans.
Yeah, I'll be right with you.
Is it my imagination or does Cosima have bigger breasts than you? There's no way I can make dinner with Kira tonight.
Well, you've got to.
I can't, I'm stuck with Art and this bitch is right on top of me.
I can lead her straight to Kira.
I know, but Mrs.
S gave you an ultimatum, she's gonna cut you off.
Rock and a hard place here, Fe.
Yeah, your permanent address.
I do have one really idiotic idea.
Oh, good.
I need to be at two places at once, yeah? - Yeah.
- Well If anybody can do that, we can.
Are you effing serious? Yeah, suddenly I am.
What happened? - Is she okay? - Yeah, she's okay, she's fine.
That doesn't sound okay.
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.
I'll get the drawings out to my criminal psych guy.
Where's missing persons on our Jane Doe? - Nothing local.
- Well, widen the net.
How wide? North America.
Whoa, quick change.
Huh? Your whole look, it's cleaned right up.
- Looks way better.
- Keep it in your pants, Raj.
Uh, sorry Guys, what the hell? Nice to know someone's having fun.
Maggie Chen.
I'm sorry, but she wants me to impersonate her in front of her own daughter.
- Who she hasn't seen in almost a year.
- Ten months.
This is terrible parenting, Felix.
I mean, that poor child.
I don't think you understand the situation here.
If Sarah misses tonight, then she may never get Kira back.
I'm sorry, but a request like this Maybe the child is better off with your foster mother.
Excuse me? Sarah is out there risking her life, playing cat and mouse with killer clone so that your kids don't end up orphans and you think that she should lose her child for that.
Yeah, I think you need to step up here, sister.
Well, I did just play Annelle in âSteel Magnoliasâ.
- Seriously? - Mmm-hmm.
Glendale Community Theater.
Annelle.
An Oh, my God! - The Daryl Hannah part? - Yeah.
It's terrible casting.
Um, it was actually very good acting, Felix.
Trust me, Sarah's no stretch.
I got great reviews.
From the whole neighborhood, I'm sure.
"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
" Okay, Eliza, holy shit! We need to pull a full reverse Pygmalion here.
Guess what? My crime psych guy says, biblically messed up or not, woman-on-woman means it's got to be personal, whether it's her first or fifteenth kill.
Yeah, no.
That makes sense.
So we're back to Jane Doe and who she was to Jane Death.
Something's got to give and when it does Yeah, right behind you.
These are your worst clothes? Well, I'm sorry, mate, but I don't shop second-hand.
No! No! It's My God, no! It's not "mate," all right? It's more like, um It's like, mate.
- Mate.
- Yeah? 'Ello, mate.
Yeah, um, that's better.
But, look, you're gonna have to get past Mrs.
S, so you've really got to play the, um, the dreary history there, you know? I mean you basically won't talk.
This shirt is all wrong.
Hey, hey, hey! Not hey! You're a punk! Be one.
Oi! Detective Childs.
There's a visitor for you.
Hey, hey, hey! What're you doing here? You said come get you.
What happened? You okay? Yeah! Yeah, no, I'm fine, really! You didn't sound fine and you don't look fine.
Come on, I took the rest of the day off, whatever you need, okay? Uh, no, no, no.
No! - Paul? - Paul, I can't.
- Everything all right here? - Does she seem all right to you? Okay, take it easy.
First day back, she gets beat up.
No wonder she wants to leave.
- Oh, what the hell are you talking about? - No, no, no, no, no! Paul, please.
Art, I got this.
Do you? What am I doing here? Sorry I overreacted, I I didn't mean, literally, come get me this second.
Then what did you mean? Seriously, you're like a completely different person these days.
I'm sorry.
It's this case.
It's a bitch.
I got upset so I asked you to come get me.
I didn't say I minded.
Look, we need to spend some time together, figure out what's suddenly going on with us because Most of it I like A lot.
Paul You get back.
So, the woman Beth shot and Helena are connected.
Holy watershed! Oaky, Beth probably shot Maggie Chen on purpose.
She never told us anything about this.
Yeah, she never told her partner either.
I can't keep doing this, Cosima, Helena was here, she was Beth.
She's going to get us both busted unless I meet her - Alone! - Oh my God, bad idea.
Yeah.
She thinks we have a connection.
- Do you? - Yeah, we're clones.
Right! So, what do the cops know? She's a churchy psychopath, duh.
It's personal.
She's a loner, probably abused as a child.
Okay, so the fish reads Christian.
And crafted on to a weapon, a personal crusade.
Great.
Is that it? You know, when I'm seeing this branded onto Maggie Chen, I'm thinking that she's not a lone warrior.
To extreme creationist types we would be abominations.
Like not God's children but Satan's.
So they hate us.
And she's killing us even though she is identical to us.
Well, but if you were a messed up, abused, loner whose faith compels you to belong and somebody that you trusted told you that this was the way to redeem yourself in the eyes of God, I mean Yeah, I might become an angry angel too.
Okay, got it.
Thanks.
Something you want to tell me? About Paul? No.
I've got him wrapped around my little finger.
What's he talking about? Leaving? We just got you back, Beth.
No, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
- Things are just messy right now.
- Yeah, I heard that.
- But we don't bring that shit in here, right? I know.
It's so freaking embarrassing, don't worry, it won't happen again.
I thought you two are calling it quits.
Yeah, we were, but now we're trying to work it out.
You know how things go.
Right.
Let's get back on track.
This killer, you had a close quarters run-in with her, did you get anything else? Something she said? If she'd said anything, I would've known she's a woman.
Yeah.
We'll check with Beckwith.
- She's making progress on Jane Doe.
- Mmm.
Should have facial reconstruction soon.
Great.
Detective Childs.
Things must be getting uncomfortable there for you now.
Helena, you've forgot something.
Your friend Maggie.
Oh, you're a terrible detective.
Beth figured that out.
Well, Beth shot her, not me, if it's revenge you're after.
It's not about revenge, it's about you.
Right, we have a connection.
- You want to tell me about that? - In person.
You have my invitation.
My name is Detective Beth Childs.
I murdered Margaret Chen.
It wasn't an accident.
I shot her on purpose.
I'm gasping for a fag.
No, you're not, Sarah never smoked.
Okay, it's curtain time.
So, just remember that an insult is a greeting but you're trying not to lose your temper, yeah? Mm-hmm.
And, um Wait! Um Thanks.
Okay.
- Over slouching, you're over slouching.
- Shut up.
Now you've got her.
Oh, hi, Mrs.
S.
Not driving a nice, new Jag today then? - It's in the shop.
- Mmm-hmm.
You're going to let me see my daughter or what? What're you gaping at? Something I can do? You ever fight a woman? Depends, business or pleasure? Look, they do say, crazy makes you strong.
But women, they look different, fight different, smell different.
This woman is a trained sniper.
But Beth taking her for a man, that flies with you? Mmm.
The whole time it feels like she's got something else chewing on her leg.
You know, civilian shootings are hard to shake.
Maybe she's back too soon.
I don't know if that's even it.
Where is she anyway? Could be she's just working it out with her boyfriend right? Yeah, yeah, could be.
- What? - Nothing.
So what now, invisible ink? Mind the store, Angie.
Maybe I should come with Come on Art, what's up? You'll know when I do.
Kira, your mum's waiting.
Hurry up, come on.
There she is, look, she's here.
She's won't bite, love.
What? You shy now or something? Is that for me? Can I see it? Oh.
How about a cuppa in the kitchen, yeah? Wow.
You give us a hug.
I'm sorry, we haven't seen each other in a long time, but we can change all that, see each other all the time.
You're not my mother.
Don't be silly.
Of course I'm your mum.
Who else would I be? You just look like her.
It's still me, Kira.
What do you call me? - Monkey.
- What else? Monkey Bum Face? Where's my mum? Art, if you're hearing this, you found a body.
It's not Beth.
It's me.
My name is Sarah Manning and you're about the only person I trust to figure the whole thing out.
Kira, your mother couldn't be here right now.
Why? Police! Stay inside.
Shit.
Because she's out there right now, doing something very brave.
She's making sure everything is safe, so you two can be together.
I'm unarmed.
Turn around.
Turn around, all the way.
Kneel! I'm guessing you know how.
This isn't necessary.
Kneel down! You're different than the others.
Yeah, I am.
You want to talk, let's talk.
I think I'm dying.
Yeah, I think I'll watch.
Where did you come from? I came out the woodwork.
Where did you come from? - God sent me.
- Right.
So you don't know either.
You don't know God.
This God? This God? The one branded on your friend Maggie Chen? Maggie helped make you.
And she saw the light and came to our side.
Beth killed her to protect us.
I can save you.
Right, 'cause we have a connection.
I can see a light in you.
There's a light in all of us.
No! No! The others, poor copies of God's image of human beings.
But not you? You're special? They told you you were the original, didn't they? Your people It's not true what they said.
We're genetic identicals.
- Let me save you.
- You, me, that German you killed, we're all made the same.
Whoever told you different hates you as much as they hate us.
You're wrong.
What happened to you, Helena? Stay back.
Can you feel it? Beth? Beth, are you in there? Go, run! You don't feel it? - There's no one here.
- You're here.
Why? Beth? The apartment of the woman you killed? What the hell are you thinking? How can you be my Auntie Alison? My mum doesn't have any sisters.
My mum doesn't even have a mum.
Well, it's very complicated.
Um, but, Kira I'm sorry about this but it's very important that you keep this a secret.
Right? Promise? Getting on for bed time, Kira love.
Up you go, get your PJs.
Pinkies.
Bye, mummy.
Scoot.
Thanks for everything.
Well you kept your word.
You showed up.
I mean Kira.
She's well and that's, uh, down to you.
Sarah.
I'm just, uh I'm not used to an honest word on this subject.
Um, I'd like to do this again, sooner rather than later.
I'm not opposed, as long as you take it slowly.
So, I'll be by tomorrow to walk her home from school.
Straight home.
Well, all right then.
Well, unleash the doves, world peace must be right around the corner.
Piss off, you.
Well, aren't you full of surprises? You passed.
You turned S's head for your encore.
Well, that's something.
Uh-oh.
- Kira knew right away.
- No! Oh, shite! I just don't get it.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Just explain to us why you were at the home of Maggie Chen.
Like I said, I was taking a walk, to clear my head, I found myself there.
- You just found yourself there.
- Yeah.
Yes or no! Is there a connection between the Maggie Chen shooting death and this Jane Doe homicide? None.
Well you called this meeting, Beth.
What the hell are we doing here? After this Chen thing, I came back to prove that I could, but, I'm not doing anybody any good, so.
I quit.
After all we've done for you? Yeah, I appreciate it, but, uh But you bail.
Why? What is it with you? Walking out is not the answer, Childs.
So how does this go? Something like this? What'd they do to me? This is about Paul right? We think Beth was spying on him.
She wasn't messing around, was she? Maybe it's time to find out where Paul works.
What happened to your scar? Why were you in my vanity? Tell me what's in the box.
I don't know who you are.
Sarah, I thought you were dead.
Is someone trying to hurt us? Why'd you ask that? How could you do that to her?
Thomas? Easy now.
Sleep, child.
Sleep.
So the killer is still out there? Yeah.
Probably crawled back to the freaks that sent her after us.
Did you have to quit being a cop? - How can that help? - Alison, this isn't why I called.
I want to thank you for helping with Kira.
Oh.
Yeah, I get to see her tomorrow and you set that up.
So Well, she's a special little girl.
I can tell.
You're very lucky.
No! - Hey! - Beth, stop.
It's me.
Oh, my God! You asshole! You'd stab me in the eye with a nail file? Yeah! You sneak up on me in the shower, I am going to stab you in the eye with a nail file.
Aren't you supposed to be at Cody's? I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.
How sorry are you? Beth Get in.
Beth.
Hmm? Let's go away.
You're off the force, I hate my job.
Let's pack our bags.
Right now.
I'm serious.
Let's talk about it in the morning.
Now, let's put it in now! - Hey, do you want coffee? - Uh, no thanks.
How you feeling? What? No gun, no badge - Nowhere to be.
- Hmm? Let's leave.
We don't have any ties.
I have three simple words for you.
Rio de Janeiro.
We cannot just leave now and think about going to Rio.
Why not? It's what you wanted, right? Commitment? I'm ready.
I can't think about this right now.
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
You're shaking like a leaf.
- Where are you going? - I'm just going out for some air.
Okay? It's an electrode from an electroencephalogram array.
- A what? - An EEG helmet.
It monitors electrical activity in the brain.
So it wasn't a bloody dream then, was it? I knew it.
How long have I been saying this? We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment.
Sarah, where was Paul during all this? Uh, there were doctors, um Two or three of them.
He could be in on it though.
Maybe he set it up.
Well, somebody must be watching the lab rats.
Someone we know.
Well, I mean, if it were my experiment Yeah, I would put an observer close to the subject, you know, somebody to Keep tabs and accumulate data.
Cosima, what'd they do to me? I think you'd know if they'd done anything really, um, invasive.
- Oh, my God! - I'm just saying An EEG is like a neurological test and that mark on your arm looks like A blood sample.
It sounds diagnostic.
With Paul in on it I don't know.
Why? Just because he slept with you? Fe.
Yeah, we sort of ended up shagging.
Dude, that's complex.
You slept with Beth's boyfriend? Oh! Far be it for me.
I may be sleeping with my spy as well.
There's the gun you wanted.
I've got to go.
Aye, aye, where's the money? What's it for? It's a self-defence fund, yeah? Last time I checked, I'm the only one defending us.
Here's 20,000.
Please use it wisely.
Yeah, I'll bring you the receipts.
I'm gonna shoot Paul's balls off.
Wait, just squeeze them, okay.
He's our way into this whole thing.
But if my blind subject were suddenly to become Self aware.
It'd either be a eureka moment or Yeah? I would terminate.
So, be careful, okay? On that note Shit! - Cop station, third time today.
- No, don't answer that.
Uh, Art, what do you want? It's Raj.
Um I'm off the force, Raj.
I know.
You okay? - Yeah.
- Okay, well, you know that surveillance shit I lent you? I'm gonna need that back before they inventory.
Surveillance shit? Right.
Right! And Beth, level with me.
This is just about Paul, right? Look, I'll get it back to you in a couple of days.
Okay? So Beth had surveillance equipment.
So then she was on to Paul too.
Question is, did she find anything? It's critical.
One week she's fine, the next it's Armageddon.
No, I understand that.
But I don't want to give her any reason to react.
You tell me.
If it gets any worse, what are our options? What are you doing? - I have to call you back.
- Why Why were you in my vanity? I need scissors.
Who were you talking to? - Just now? - Mmm-hmm.
Uh, Big Rich.
From work.
- About me? - About Susan Teller.
She's all over us this quarter.
You know that.
Oh, good.
Um, can you cut this tag off? It's driving me crazy.
That's better.
All right.
What do we do if he walks in? Shoot him.
I'm kidding.
Just Find the surveillance stuff, yeah? And put everything back where you found it.
This place is antiseptic.
Paul's whole world feels fake now? What? I don't leave prints when I burgle.
"Trexcom Consulting.
" If fake Paul is observing Beth, what makes you so certain no one's observing Sarah Manning? Who? Mrs.
S hates me, I haven't seen her in a year and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.
A ringing vote of confidence.
Nothing.
On Beth's computer, nothing.
No audio files, no video, no transcripts.
Holy shit! Hey, hey.
Hey.
He's military.
Looks like you're not the only one keeping secrets.
What are those? Letters from Beth.
- To Paul? I wanna read them.
- Ah, ah, ah.
No, they're private.
Where the hell is his surveillance stuff? I don't know.
We searched everywhere.
There we go.
She wasn't messing around, was she? Maybe it's time to check out where Paul works.
Oh, yeah.
Trexcom Consulting.
Fake Paul, fake company.
I bet you money there's nothing there.
No way.
Beth? We downsized, remember? Paul's office is over here now.
Oh, right.
Yeah, of course.
He's in a meeting.
Oh! You know what, um We kinda got into it This morning.
I brought him some lunch as a peace offering.
Come on.
I'll just Sure.
Big Boob Blowies? Felix, I hope you can hear this.
Yes.
Yeah, well, I can now.
You silly bitch, would you get your fanny out of there.
- You brought me lunch? - Yeah.
Olive branch.
About this morning.
You wanna talk about it? I'd rather talk about last night.
- In the shower.
- Paul I came to bring you lunch, that's all.
Something's changed both of us.
Hmm I know you can feel it.
What happened to your scar? What? The scar on your neck from the mountain bike crash.
It's gone.
Oh.
Really? I'm using a new lotion.
Let me see.
You'll try anything, won't you? I will.
But I gotta get back to work.
Thanks for lunch.
- See you tonight.
- Okay.
Madison? Clear my afternoon.
Okay? - Something came up.
- Shit.
Alison? What are you doing? Ah What's in the box, Donnie? It's private.
No, it isn't.
What is it? What is in it? - Tell me what's in the box.
- I'm entitled to a little privacy.
- Even in this house.
- Oh! That's rich coming from you.
- What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Open the box, Donnie.
- Give it to me! - Open it! Alison.
Alison, stop it! Yeah, blood looks fine.
No infection.
What kind of symptoms are we talking about? Um Shortness of breath, coughing up blood - That sort of thing.
- Who's the subject? Uh, subject And if I told you that I'd have to kill you.
And can you run a PCR on these samples.
See if there are any genetic markers? You're thinking antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis.
Yeah, that kind of thing.
And, um - Can you sequence for Cytochrome C? - The barcode gene? Mmm-hmm.
That's the one we use for species differentiation.
Is it? What's in it for me? Um, how about you get to have sex With yourself? Awesome deal.
I'm sorry.
He's a bastard.
Who? Paul.
Beth loved him but he wouldn't love her back, and he wouldn't leave her.
Hmm, but he's certainly changed his tune now, hasn't he? Sarah, he's falling for you.
God, what a mess! I'm outside Kira's school.
Of all the things that scare me right now, Fe, this one's the heaviest.
You know she can't wait to see you, right? Yeah, thanks.
She's the only thing that really matters, you know.
I know, um Give her my love, okay.
- Colin.
- Hi.
So glad you could step away.
From the morgue, uh, trust me, scheduling isn't really an issue.
Hey.
It's me this time.
I know.
God, I missed you so much.
I miss you too.
Why are you wearing such fancy clothes? You don't miss a thing, do you? Are you okay, Mommy? Yeah, I am now.
God, you're so big! I'm the smallest kid in my class.
Well, you're big to me.
How come you never told me about Aunty Alison? I didn't know her.
She looks just like you.
Yeah.
One day I'll explain it all to you.
Yeah, monkey? Is someone trying to hurt us? Why'd you ask that? Alison said you're making sure we're safe.
Hey, hey.
No.
We're safe, Kira.
I promise.
Okay? You coming in? Hey.
Sorry.
You just forgot this in the lab.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Full disclosure, I did peek.
You're French.
You have killer grades.
Thank you.
Um, oh, God! I'm so sorry, I'm not usually like this.
Oh.
Bad breakup? - Yeah, well, we're an ocean apart so - Hmm, yeah.
Long distance never works.
Um, you're in microbiology too, right? Yes.
Um, immunology.
I study host-parasite relationships.
Oh, cool.
Cool, yeah, I'm Evo Devo.
- Evolutionary development.
- Yeah, yeah.
That's what we call it here.
Delphine.
Cosima.
EnchantÃ©e.
So independent, aren't you? Hmm, monkey? - Little monkey.
- Remind you of anyone? Yeah, but I was much angrier, wasn't I? Even small.
You were the one who introduced me to punk rock, though.
Yeah.
You took all of the attitude, none of the politics.
I'm just happy she doesn't have to bounce around like I did.
I was her age when I came to live with you in London, yeah? - Little bit older.
- Well.
You got me this far.
I know that.
- I still need your help though.
- Ah.
I need you to tell me what you really know about me.
Where I came from? Why now? Trying to square things away.
For Kira, you know.
You're part of the foster system.
I took in kids.
You know, I don't know who your parents were.
Yeah, I talked to Family Services in Brixton already.
I just wondered if there's anything else.
Is everything okay? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
What about Vic? - Vic still in the picture? - God, no.
That much I can promise.
Vic is done.
How you doing, boss? Nice to see you, Pouchy.
Pouchy, she jumped in front of a train.
I don't even know why she did it.
Right, sure we had our ups and down but everything was fine.
She had the coke on her.
So, I'm thinking maybe the cops have it.
Give me one week, Pouchy.
I'll get you your money.
- You say that last week.
- I know.
I'm good for it.
Wait a minute, I'm good for it, Pouchy.
You know me.
Pouchy, please.
Wait a minute, Pouchy.
One more week I'll get you your money.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Pouchy, please.
One more week, man.
Okay! Give me a minute! Don't cut it.
Okay, all right.
I'll give the money.
Okay.
Okay, give me a minute.
I just need the time.
I'm good.
Okay.
One chocolate bar each.
That's it.
Okay.
Hold your sister's hand.
- Okay? And don't talk to anybody.
- Okay, Mom.
- I love you.
- Love you too, Mom.
Uh, deterrents or surveillance? Surveillance, please.
Something small.
You mean something like this? Wireless, discrete.
They call it the nanny cam.
Sometimes the nanny's pinching your valuables, sometimes your husband's pinching the nanny, you know? Just show me how it works, please.
Stay in school.
I mean it, buddy.
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah.
Sarah, hey, Sarah.
Sarah, you're alive! Sarah, it's me.
Look at me.
I don't - I don't know who you are.
- You bitch, you faked it.
- You've got the wrong person.
- You faked it, you bitch! How could you do this to me? Sarah, I thought you were dead.
How could you goddamn do this to me? My eyes! Ah, you bitch! Ah! - Ah, there you are.
- Goddamn it.
Goddamn Okay, it's a race into the car.
- Me, me.
First me.
- Sarah! Hey, whoever gets in first, wins.
- Who's that guy? - Uh, Sarah You bitch.
Hello, Alison.
I was just assaulted by a disgusting thug who thought I was you.
Who? What'd he look like? I don't know, he was Urban.
What the hell does that mean? Not white, okay.
Oh, shit! Vic.
Wha What happened? I assaulted him back is what happened.
Please tell me that's not Kira's father.
No, no.
Absolutely not.
Well, what's going on with Paul? Well, we think Beth was spying on him.
We found surveillance gear.
She never told me about that.
Is it true? Is he a mole? I don't know that yet.
What's going on with you? Nothing, I'm fine.
Call me when you know something for sure.
Olivier? Paul.
What are you doing here? Is something wrong? We need to talk about Beth.
How was she this morning? Fine.
Everything's fine.
You don't do this sort of thing much, do you? You mean with a live person? Oh! Right Morgue humor.
You're awfully cute.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
The morgue attendant? Really? - Can you knock? - Brilliant, Fe.
Shagging the bloke that we conned into identifying my body.
Colin is the first nice boy I've met in ages.
- What? Like six weeks? - No.
- At least eight.
- Where do you think this is gonna go? - Hey? - Oh, my God! I'm so sorry, I completely forgot rule number one.
That your life is always more important than mine.
No, it's just way more difficult.
- Vic is back.
- No shit? Yeah, he ran into Alison so he thinks I'm alive.
I'll figure it out.
I'll I need to know what happened at Paul's office.
Sorry.
I've been a bit busy, haven't I? Well, it did record something.
What are you doing here? Is something wrong? - This is it.
- We need to talk about Beth.
- How was she this morning? - Fine.
Everything's fine.
You still concerned about her mental health? No, she's better.
Suddenly better? You understand your role as monitor is not to interfere Monitor? If there's anything pertinent I should know, anything at all If there were, I would tell you.
Oh, shit! It's him.
No, don't answer that.
No! - Hello.
- Beth - Where are you? - Out.
Where are you? We have to talk.
- About what? - I need you to come home.
Yeah, I don't think so.
He knows something.
Well, you can't go back there.
You know that.
No, I can't.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God! - Paul followed me straight to Kira.
Is this a bad time? You tased me, you maced me.
And you think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna walk away, like I'm nobody? - I was working a job.
- Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you would have ruined the whole thing.
Yeah? I guess you're on a roll now, huh, Sarah? And that coke that you stole from me? Pretending to be dead.
Who do you think took the fall for that? Huh? Pouchy took my finger.
If I don't come up with 15K He's gonna lobster me.
A finger every week until all I have left is a lobster claw.
Sit down, sit down.
Do you want the money or not? There's 20K.
Fifteen for your debt and then five for your pain and suffering.
It must have been some play.
Uh-uh.
This is piss-off money, okay? You don't get to know anything.
I'm entitled to know everything.
Can I ask you a question? How do you do it? Lying there in that morgue? Holding your breath, Sarah, while I am bawling? I'm crying like a goddamn child.
You know what's crazy? You know how stupid I am? I'm standing here looking at you and all I keep thinking about is Myrtle Beach.
- You remember? - Out.
Yeah, that was a long time ago, Vic.
I was working with that mook Angel, he got you in with the carnies.
I'm not proud of what we did.
We were on top of the world, Sarah.
We were parasites.
No.
We were in love.
Not me.
Ever.
I think, she means it, Victor.
You want that money? Take it and go now.
Right now, Vic! Okay.
It's not over, Sarah.
Is every man in your life a complete wanker, except me? I need you to go to S's house.
Make sure Kira's okay.
Yeah? You're not going back to Paul's.
I will not let him threaten my daughter.
Sarah, you're not going back to Paul's.
Sarah! No, it's fine.
Don't worry.
If anything else comes up, I'll let you know.
- Felix called yet? - Yeah.
He just played me the recording.
I heard everything.
Um, where are you? I'm about to go in, and shoot Paul in the balls.
Wait, Sarah.
This is our chance to get answers.
He followed me to Kira, Cos.
I know, I know.
But he also covered for you.
Right? That Olivier guy, he asked if anything was wrong and Paul said no.
Why? Because, I think he might be falling for fake Beth.
Yes! That's awesome.
That You can use that.
Who do you think got me into this mess in the first place? Huh? Okay.
I know.
Just chill.
I think that Olivier guy, he runs Paul.
It sounds like some kind of double-blind.
What are you going on about? They are keeping Paul in the dark too.
Right? So that he can't skew the results either.
You mean, he may not even know he's watching a clone? Yes, right.
But Olivier definitely knows.
Okay, he's the one that we need to get to.
You mind if I get through Paul first? Sarah? I'll sleep on the couch.
Donnie, Donnie.
You're right.
Everyone deserves their privacy.
Come.
I thought you handed in your sidearm.
Huh? Left jacket pocket, hanging low.
Well, apparently, I've got a stalker.
Sit.
Put it on the table.
I knew.
I couldn't put my finger on it, but I knew.
It was that day you were supposed to do the hearing, first time we had sex in months.
What? I missed you.
You were wearing that Clash t-shirt.
I was like, "What?" And then, wham, you screw me, right on the kitchen counter.
You complaining, Paul? What are you saying? You quit the force.
After refusing ever even to think it.
You know what I've been through.
And then the scar on your neck just disappears.
Because of what? Some cream? And now This little girl.
I was there when Beth found out she couldn't have kids.
So, who is this girl? She's my half-sister.
I watched you together.
She's your daughter, isn't she? You're losing it.
Am I? I was looking at some old video today.
You were training for that half-marathon.
What was the last race you ran? What city was it in? Where is Beth? One last time, whoever you are, where is Beth? She killed herself.
She jumped in front of a train.
You're English.
Who are you? I'm her twin.
Twin? Is this a test? A test of what? Beth didn't have a sister.
What's your name? Sarah.
Sarah what? Sarah's good enough.
When Beth died, I took her identity.
Beth isn't dead.
Look, I was just gonna clean out her bank accounts.
I didn't mean to get all tangled up with you.
If she really is dead, how do I know you didn't kill her? - 'Cause you killed her.
- What? You're her monitor, aren't you? And what's that? You observe her.
You let people into her home.
Like last night.
Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep.
And she knew.
You're a plant and she killed herself because the man that she loved turned her whole life into a lie.
She knew you didn't love her and she couldn't understand why you wouldn't leave.
And now she figured it out.
This isn't true.
It is a sick test, isn't it? Isn't it? She trusted you.
How could you do that to her? You think I had a choice.
Just tell me why? They don't tell us why.
Where did you go in the middle of the night, Donnie? I don't know, Never Never Land.
What's the emergency? - Hi.
- We're not late for the potluck? I may have a monitor dilemma of my own.
It's really nice to make a friend in the brave new world.
That is a really good look on you.
Ridiculous.
Do I gotta do everything around here? Three hours to go and the dishes still haven't been washed.
The drink cart hasn't been loaded up.
The kids' gift bags haven't been sorted.
And did we even get ice? Hello! Did we get ice? Alison, come on.
Get with the program here, we need to get moving.
Where did you go in the middle of the night, Donnie? Ah I don't know.
Never-never land? I woke up.
You weren't in bed.
Honey, we don't have time for this.
The kids are outside doing God knows what, we got a million things to do and you're not helping! Just make a list of what we need and I'll do it and when I'm out getting the damn ice.
I need to know where you went, Donnie.
Look, I know we had a bad day yesterday.
A bad day? Is that what you call it? Where are you going? I'm going out to get the stuff that you were supposed to get yesterday! I'm trying to have a conversation with you, Donnie.
And oh, what a joy it is! But don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll talk about this later.
It's all good.
Ah! My problems didn't start in the military.
They started out of uniform, as a private contractor.
Understand? I'm not doing any of this by choice.
All right.
So, they forced you to be Beth's monitor for two years without even knowing why.
Are you some kind of hustler? You understand leverage, right? The difference is you chose to infiltrate Beth's life, to screw her boyfriend right on this counter.
And you weren't even you.
And you aren't you either.
I don't think you understand how serious this is.
We need to try and be honest with each other, twin sister.
Okay.
Let's see what happens to the results of the medical test you performed on me.
I wanted to get you away from that.
I'm serious about Rio.
Just tell me what happens to the results.
They go to Olivier.
From there I don't know.
- What are you doing? - I'm gonna take a shower.
Wash off the filth.
Is that okay with you? So do you think the results might tell them I'm not Beth? I don't know what the tests are for.
I explained that.
This is my world, Sarah.
It is you that I'm worried about.
Yeah? What is it that worries you about me? Whatever it is you're not telling me.
Sarah? Hey, Cosima, you were right.
Paul doesn't even know about clones.
See, it's a double blind.
Um, the monitors are unaware of the purpose of the experiment.
That way they can't skew the results.
Oh, hey.
I just had to get out of there.
I don't even know where I am going.
Right.
I may have a monitor dilemma of my own.
Um, I'm new here, this semester.
I didn't bring anybody with me, but, uh, someone wants to be friends.
Just stay away from them, Cos.
Stick to the science, yeah? Stick to the science? What am I, the geek monkey now? Seriously, Paul's a bad ass okay.
He's ex-military.
If somebody's trying to get close to you just stay away.
Right.
The old "do as I say, not as I do.
" Sorry Look, Alison's calling through.
Are we good? Sure.
Hey! - I need you.
- What's going on? Um I have a situation.
What kind of situation? Just get over here right now.
- Hey that's not fair! - Oh, then I'll get you again.
Okay, okay.
You're gonna walk your sister to Aynesley's house - and you're gonna stay there.
- But Mom! - Yes.
It's gonna be fun.
- No! Go.
Tell her I said it's okay.
Where are you off to, Sarah? Ah! Alison? - Why am I tied to the chair? - Shh! Tell me what was really in the box, Donnie.
What? Your special box.
What was inside of it? Are you out of your mind? Untie me.
No.
Donnie I have questions that needs answers.
Come on, Alison, this is insane! Don't worry, honey.
It's all good.
Isn't that what you always tell me? Think about what you really want to get off your chest.
Or what, you're gonna stick sequins on me? - You moved the files.
- Files? What files? Your files that you have on me from your box.
Your special box.
Ahhh! Have you lost your mind? I know what you do, Donnie.
- What? What do I do? - You spy.
You perform medical examinations on me in my sleep.
- What? - You turned my whole life into a big embarrassing lie! - Oh, no! - And you switched the files in your special box for porno DVDs! A Big Boob Blowies! Ahhh! - Hey, Delphine.
- Hey.
- Bonjour Cosima.
- I'm bored.
Well, you know, there's this lecture today that I was going to see Wait, where is it? Um, I was going to.
If you want to come with me.
Neolutionism.
Really? You've You've heard of it? Yeah, it's like kind of fringe, don't you think? Well, I think that, as a Darwinist, it would interest you.
And this Dr.
Leekie is a really, really, I saw his TED Talk online and Whew! Hmm.
So Sure.
Why not? Sarah, I can understand why you took off this morning, but I need We need to know that the ground beneath us is solid.
So, please.
Let's talk about all this tonight.
Why do you do it, Donnie? Alison, I don't examine you in your sleep.
Oh, no.
No.
Am I sick like the German? What German? Who's German? Oh, no! - What the hell is going on, Alison? - Shh! Please, no.
What are you doing? Please.
Argh! Alison, no! Hi.
What's the emergency? Umm You might wanna sit down for this.
Uh I'll stand.
Thanks.
Okay.
Alison? Alison? - Who's that? - Alison.
- Donnie.
- Who's Donnie? He's my husband.
- What? - I think he's my watcher.
Jesus Christ! Alison, what have you done? Al? Yoo-who! Hello? Who's that? Oh! I completely forgot.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're not ready for the pot luck.
Oh, yeah.
Umm You're not even dressed.
Well, I was just thinking, could we change venues? Change venues? Ali, what's wrong? I Nothing, I'm just not I think I'm coming down with something.
- I think we should - Well, it's too late now.
So just take some of your happy pills and let me help.
Don't worry, we'll get this party started.
Okay.
- What's up, Hendrix? - Mmm! Hello, hi.
Hi.
- Is this a pajama party? - Good.
- Ali.
- Hmm.
- Nothing's ready.
- Oh, I know.
Cover for me.
- What's all off limits? - Hmm.
The basement.
Uh, it's a disaster.
- Donnie's starting renos this week.
- Oh! Mmm-hmm.
Well, the kids are screaming for chips.
I'll go get some from the pantry.
- Sausage rolls, freezer.
- Got it.
Okay.
- A pot luck? Seriously? - Seriously.
- Okay, you got to kick them out.
- I can't, back out of the monthly pot luck.
It's my turn.
And I have no gift bags, no ice, and no bartender because my husband is tied to a chair.
Alison, you need to take a deep breath.
- I hate yoga.
- Okay.
You need to go up there and just play hostess like nothing's wrong.
Fine.
You interrogate Donnie.
- What? - Yes.
You are the expert.
Go in there and then get that lying bastard to confess.
- What Are you serious? - Be me.
Put this on.
What if he's just your husband? Sarah, I need you to help me with this.
I impersonated you, in front of your daughter.
Now it's your turn.
With a golf-club? No.
No, I can't bartend.
I've got a very handsome guest here.
Please tell me you're not with the morgue attendant again.
No, but I plan to be.
Hang on.
Teddy, is that all you can handle? All right.
Looks like my afternoon just opened up.
Okay.
How soon can you be here? - To Scarberia? - Yeah.
- And dress suburban.
- You've got to be joking.
I know, it sucks to be my sister.
Don't forget the ice.
Well! Okay.
Kids are looking for the gift bags.
And we're running out of wine glasses.
Where are your disposables? They are under the sink.
No.
Uh, top shelf, left hand side of the stove.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's going on downstairs? - Sausage roll? - No, thanks.
So Meera wants to know the name of your contractor.
Oh! I will give you his info.
- Perfect.
- Okay.
Sausage? No, okay.
That's all right.
She's drunk already? Whoopsie-whoo! Red chili.
Did you want one? And where the hell's Donnie? Hello, Donnie.
Donnie.
Hello, Donnie.
- Alison.
- Shh! - Can we stop now, please? - Yes.
After a few questions.
You told me yesterday she was fine.
She's right back in her dark place, Olivier.
Stopped her from OD-ing on pills last night.
She's quit the force, dumped her therapist.
She has no one else.
She has you to share in this crisis like any other event.
Don't interfere unless it's critical.
I need to know that I won't be blamed if she tries it again.
If I can't stop her.
You've done well for us, Paul.
A long as your subject makes her own choices there are no wrong decisions.
Yes? Then, so long as you're on.
I know, Donnie.
So you can Tell me how it works.
How what works? The double blind.
Monitoring.
Alison, would you listen to yourself? I got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket! Cricket? The South African games start at 4:00 a.
m.
Is there nothing in my life left unexamined by you? Now take off the GD blindfold! The whole neighborhood is here? What kind of irrational nonsense is going through that head of yours! Hey, watch your tone, Donnie.
Alison, get your frazzled PMS shit together! Hey! You watch your tone! Your wife is the rock of this family.
You will no longer speak down to her.
Am I clear? Yeah.
- Cosima? Hey.
- Hey.
- I am so glad you came.
- Mmm-hmm.
You won't be disappointed.
Yeah, I can tell.
Yeah.
Dr.
Leekie attracts diverse thinkers.
- Come.
- Okay.
Oh.
Neolution, a philosophy of today for tomorrow.
Rooted in our past, in the evolution of the human organism.
But before we go to the future, let me take you back to the great, Greek philosopher, Plato, and his twilight years.
Poor old Plato was going blind.
Going lame and losing his hearing.
Now, imagine if he knew we could correct his sight, restore his hearing and replace his ailing body parts with titanium ones.
Plato would have thought we were gods.
But we're not.
We're just fundamentally flawed human beings.
Your glasses, for example, make you somewhat, um Platonic.
But within the very near future, I'll be able to offer you the ability to see into a spectrum never before seen by the naked eye.
Infrared, X-rays, ultraviolet.
- You interested? - Maybe I'll just start with basic LASIK.
And so you should.
That's making an evolutionary choice.
Neolution gives us the opportunity at a self-directed evolution.
And I believe that's not only a choice but a human right.
Oh, Felix, Felix, Felix.
All right, Felix.
Time to party with the party.
Hello.
Oh, shit! I totally thought you were Alison.
Have you looked in the mirror? There's a thing on your head.
Shit, as they say, it's completely sideways, Fe.
What do you need? - Crackers.
- Hmm.
- What? - Do you have any crackers? How should I know, Charity? Why don't you go check the cracker cupboard.
Alison.
Meera is talking.
Where is Donnie? Oh, my God.
Why isn't he helping you with this? He's tied up.
Ali, don't you dare cover for him.
Not again and not to me.
- Hmm.
- You know what I've been going through with Chad.
- Hey, ladies.
- Incoming.
I am all over those sexy stretches.
You've been working your glutes again.
What's your program? Why is everybody asking me so many goddamn questions? Hello, neighbors.
Your bartender's here.
I'm just gonna have a quick word with our hostess and then I'm gonna be right back to, uh, top you up.
Yeah? Let's go.
It's a gay bartender, that's awesome.
Chad, shut your stupid mouth and feed the kids.
No.
- Oh.
- What the I screwed up, didn't I? It's not Donnie.
He said he didn't It's not him.
But I whacked him and it felt so good.
Is he really in there? Yeah, tied to a chair.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
I'll go handle the mess upstairs.
Right.
I tortured my husband.
I messed up my family.
And you're the only person I can talk to and you're just another version of me.
Come on.
I'm a horrible person.
I'm not even a real person.
Of course you are.
Look, you stood up to all this so far.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Alison.
Donnie says that he got up in the middle of the night to watch cricket.
- Cricket? - Yeah.
Look, Paul's military.
He's a professional.
You've known Donnie since what? High school.
Right.
High school.
Yeah.
So how could he be your monitor? So he's just Donnie? Eating, farting Donnie? My monitor is probably one of those bitches upstairs.
Alison, just Alison! I know.

Little did I know Well, I enjoyed your lecture very much.
Oh, thank you so much, thank you.
You know, I'm in immunology.
Hmm.
And you? Um, evo-devo.

This is none of my business.
Time to go home.
Donnie.
About my little, um, - breakdown, um - No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You're right.
You are the rock of this family.
I'm so sorry.
Of course you knew.
It wasn't just porn in my special box.
You remember Ginny Neusbaum? From college? I don't know how to say this But she and I had an affair once.
Okay, twice.
But you and I were broken up.
We traded letters for a few years after it ended.
Dirty talk, mostly.
Then she got lupus and I never heard from her again.
She got lupus? I don't know what happened to her.
I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to hold on to something personal.
Something I'm sorry.
Drink? Yeah.
Talk.
Clones.
Well, we don't use the C-word.
That's Alison's rule.
But, yeah, we're genetic identicals.
Not triplets? Genetic identicals? Yeah, we count nine of us so far.
That's what you do, Paul.
That's why you were watching Beth.
You monitor human clones.
You should have just told me that in the first place.
Stay away from me.
I have an offer for you.
You have until midnight.
If there was a club here don't you think I'd know about it? Beth's paperwork is a mess.
It's like she's never done it before.
So let's get forensics to pull the hand.
Run a fresh set of prints.
All right, you gotta see this.
The subject isn't who we think she is.
She's an impostor.
Help make this right, Afghanistan goes away.
I can tell you have a very unique perspective, Cosima.
- She's very cheeky.
- Mmm-hmm.
But that's why I like her.
Detective Mark Bell.
I need to talk to you about Beth Childs.
