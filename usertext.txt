Huxley Station.
Ugh, shit.
Sorry.
Next stop, Huxley Station.
Next train to New York City will be departing on Platform 8B in 10 minutes.
Next train to New York City, Platform 8B in 10 minutes.
Hey, hey! It's Sarah.
Yeah, I'm I'm back in town.
I wanna see Kira, okay? Well, that's not fair, is it? Can I at least speak to her? Hello? Bitch.
Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop the train! Somebody help.
No! Get some help down here, now! Elizabeth Childs.
Two phones.
Oh, my God.
You look like crap.
- Hi! - Hello! No, seriously, ew! All right.
How's life, Felix? This long no see, you don't get to know.
I didn't miss your birthday, did I? No, I know.
It's totally pedestrian, the only reason I'm here.
- Oi, Bobby.
- Hey, Felix.
- Guinness? - Yeah.
How's Vic the dick? Yeah, I hit him first this time.
With an ashtray, so He's a little blue.
- Coke? - It's Vic's.
Think you can flip it to one of your Bay Street blow boys? You have no idea what that costs me.
I'll give you 20%.
I wasn't talking about my cut, Sarah.
I was talking about my pride.
What are you up to? I'm here for Kira, Fe.
After what happened, you really think Mrs.
S is gonna let you take her? She's my daughter, she's gonna have to.
You've been gone for almost a year, Sarah.
I'm not judging, I'm just saying.
All right.
Ta! Yeah, so I'm back on the run, the usual Sarah shite storm.
Apparently.
Well, on that note, something really weird just happened at the train station.
What? I saw a girl kill herself.
Ew! A jumper? Yeah, and she looked exactly like me, Felix.
What do you mean? Oh, you robbed her body.
No, she left her bag on the platform.
Ain't that essentially robbing her body? Okay, that's weird.
Yeah, you think? Elizabeth Childs.
It's you with a nice haircut.
And a nice address.
What the hell, Fe, did I have a twin sister? Well, now, when you're a poor little orphan foster wretch, anything's possible.
Or so we tell ourselves.
I'm gonna go up to her flat.
Yeah, to find out who she is, to rob the rest of her shit.
Or car.
There has to be a car.
Is that her phone? - Yeah.
- Well, answer it.
Try and get 20k for it, yeah? All right, fine.
What about Vic? I'll call ya.
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay.
Hello? Boyfriend.
Squares.
Paul Deardon.
Out of town till Saturday.
Well Shitful quality.
I'll give you 10 for it.
You can do better.
I'll think about it.
Think fast.
Okay.
Okay! Shit.
- What? Oh, shit.
- Where the hell is Sarah? - Where is she? - Vic, I can't breathe.
- Oh! - Sarah! Sarah! - What the hell is wrong with you? - Move.
Where the hell is Sarah? - Toodles.
- Where is she? I don't know.
I haven't seen her in like a year.
She's been with you.
- Bullshit! - She's not my problem anymore.
Listen to me, Felix, I'm just gonna ask you once.
Where is the coke? Cocaine? Felix? All right, fine.
Here.
Blow me.
That's really funny.
What the hell happened to your head? Well, let's see, Sarah blindsided me, then she took off with the coke.
Listen to me! Listen to me.
Listen, I'm on the hook with Pouchy.
Look at me, you understand? Look at me.
That's gonna bring pain on me.
Till I find her, it's on you.
You mind if I have this? I'll be back, she better be here, fruitcake.
Lovely to see you again, Victor.
Sarah.
It's Beth.
So, my credit is max, but I've got a sweet pad and my new boyfriend, Paul's, out of town till the weekend.
Unfortunately, your real boyfriend, Vic the dick, - is already here.
- Shit! Oh, I'm fine, by the way, thank you.
I'm sorry, Fe.
And your blow is abysmal, by the way.
- I'll be lucky to get 10k for it.
- What? That's not enough.
- For what? - To get out, Fe.
Set ourselves up with Kira somewhere.
Sarah, who is Elizabeth Childs? I don't know.
Just a girl who looks like me.
Girl with a pretty nice life.
If it was so nice, why did she kill herself? Hold on.
Fe? She's got $75,000 in her savings account.
Say again? The account was just opened like three weeks ago.
That's enough to lose bloody Vic, yeah? We can get away with this, Fe.
The three of us.
Sarah, any second, someone's gonna ID the body, and it's game over.
So you should really just drop it all right now.
Nice work, with the ashtray, by the way.
Vic has stitches.
- Hello? - I'm standing outside - Huxley Station, right now, - Shh, shut up, I'm thinking.
which we can see is emptying out.
Authorities have cleared out the station after an unidentified woman fell onto the tracks and was killed.
Our witnesses aren't sure how the woman came to be on the tracks, or whether foul play was involved.
Fe, I have an idea.
All right, give me a big smile.
- I want a big smile.
- Why are you shooting me? 'Cause I love shooting.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, shit.

In your own words, please, begin by stating your name.
Anytime, Detective.
I panicked.
What do you want me to say? Pretty much anything, but "I panicked".
I'm kidding.
Where's your wit gone? You haven't called me dipshit all day.
You don't have to babysit me, dipshit.
I know.
But who else would? Thanks, Doc.
See you next week.
Look, Beth, I know this thing has got you all twisted up, but you gotta forgive yourself.
Shootings happen, to whoever's there, with a gun in their hand.
Hmm.
Dr.
Bower will see you now.
Felix, open the goddamn door.
Felix, I know you're in there, open the door now.
Oh.
You bastard.
What the hell is wrong with you? Huh? Where's Sarah? Sarah is dead.
I'm sorry, what? She's dead.
Vic She killed herself.
Yeah? Bullshit.
Where is she, Felix? She jumped in front of a train because you are such an arsehole! What's this? Her death certificate.
Bullshit.
It's not real.
I identified her body.
- Vic, she's dead! She's gone.
- Okay, Felix, stop it.
Stop! Stop it.
She told you to say this? She's not dead.
Where is she? Stupid bitch.
Sarah? - It's not coming back to you? - Hmm No, I'm I'm Not really.
Uh, I I know I shot a civilian.
Maggie Chan? 44, single, churchgoer.
I'm just missing, uh Missing what? Explain.
Uh Myself.
Um Yeah, um, I glitched.
Break or something.
I think I need some leave.
You're under suspension.
Right.
See, I'm having trouble with detail.
So, I'm not sure I should say anything at all.
It's okay.
It's all confidential.
Have you shared any of these dissociations with Paul? Yeah, no We're fine.
I don't wanna talk about Paul.
Paul's away.
No, he's in Cleveland.
Beth Uh, waitress makes a mistake at work, she, what, drops a plate of meat loaf, doesn't get a tip.
- Hmm - Try to separate mistake from result.
Getting back on the job for you is all about moving forward from a moment you can never take back.
You need to talk to me about that moment.
About seeing cell phone and reacting gun.
Mmm-hmm.
Can I make another appointment? So, your twin, all hopped up on cop tranquilizers, guns down an innocent Chinese lady holding a cell phone in her hand.
- Is that true? I don't know.
I'm not even sure her partner knows.
Feels like she's lying about something.
For 75 grand in a new account.
She well dodgy.
Yeah, whatever she was into drove her plenty nuts, yeah.
Yeah.
Suicide's thrilling, agreed.
But Can we get the elephant out of the room? What? Well, look at her.
You're related.
This could be your story.
It's not.
Every foster kid dreams of their lost family.
Oh, my God! Deep down we all hope we're special.
Yeah, the last thing I am is special.
If that was my boyfriend, I'd jump in front of a train too.
Don't say that.
Paul's hot and you know it.
Oh, Vic Is keening like a banshee.
He wants a funeral.
He can't have a funeral! The whole sad point is nobody would notice if I died.
What's this? Birth certificates? Alison Hendrix, Beth, Katja Obinger, born in Berlin? So their birthdays are all within a month of yours? It's a coincidence.
I don't care.
It's just a score, Fe.
Let me finish what I started and then, I'll come back for you and Kira, yeah? Oh! You're gonna disappear again? Yeah, I have to, Fe.
It's dangerous shit in this life.
- Somebody keeps texting her.
- Oh, texting! My God, how terrifying! Look, Fe, sell the coke, and keep half the money and give the other half to Kira, yeah? You left Kira with Mrs.
S overnight and you didn't come back for 10 months.
I'm trying to fix this.
Tell it to the angels, Sarah.
You're already dead.
Shit.
Beth? Beth? Hi.
Hey.
"The Clash"? Oh, yeah, uh London calling.
The Clash rock.
Yeah, but you don't.

Just gym stuff.
Weren't you coming back on the weekend? Well, I wanted to be here.
So - Yeah? - How was the hearing? Oh, uh I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.
You skipped it? Um, no Um I got sick to my stomach, I basically puked on them.
Are you serious? Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry, I'm okay.
Beth, what's happened? A lot.
Yeah, I know, but you're I'm what? What did you do to your hair? Uh Nothing.

Felix? I'm sorry, man.
I don't know where else to go.

Why, Vic? Why are you such a dick? I don't know, I'm angry.
- Can I come in? - No! Thanks.
I can't sleep.
I keep seeing her face.
Yeah, me too.
Her pretty face.
Felix, you and me, we have to do something.
There's just no goddamn closure, bro.
We have to have like a A memorial send-off or something.
Okay, Vic.
We'll have a wake.
Really? See, that's what I'm talking about, man.
- A coming together.
- Yeah.

Yeah, it can't be today.
I've got to call Glenn, that bitch Sherry, her Montreal connections - No, no, no, no, no.

Fast and light, all right? It's gonna be an intimate memorial piss-up.
- Okay.

- That's All right, um - Thank you.
You know what, first though, you need a shower and a Xanax.
Okay.
- Mmm - Oh! For real? That was amazing.
Was it? Where you been hiding that accent for like two years? Uh, I got up for the gym, Paul.
Okay.
Well, you want to tell me what happened at the hearing? Uh, I choked, I guess, um They reconvene in a couple of days, so don't worry about it.
Beth.
Hmm.
What? Are you back on the meds? No.
Then you didn't choke.
You're just finally feeling something.
Feeling like the real you.
I got up for the gym.
Are you driving today? What? Uh, can I borrow the keys to your car? - Use your own car.
- Can't find my keys.
Did you check the thing where they always are? Yep.
Yeah, I checked the thing where they always are.
Mmm.
Nice.
Felix, we can't part angry this time.
It's not good for your skin, okay.
Call me or I'll squeeze your bloody bollocks in a vise Everything all right? Oh, yeah.
Obnoxious English relative.
Well, I've got your cash.
I just need your signature here.

Okay.
Good luck with that run.
Fe! Felix.
You little shit.
"Sarah had a big heart.
"It was always fight or flight with her.
" You guys remember how she was, right? It's all based on facts.
"She was the kind of person you want to hang on to "but she would not be held with you.
"Sarah, I'm sorry.
"I know, I've a lot to answer for.
"My favorite moment" So, is it heaven or hell? I didn't want a funeral for this very reason, Fe.
Well, you can't do much about that when you're dead, can you? I'm watching, right now.
Really? Oh! Oh! - Pathetic.
- Let me ask you I dressed Vic.
How do we look? Yeah, not as good as Rockabilly Bob.
Who knows, still Rockabilly after all these years.
Got to respect that.
Sherry is upset though, isn't she? Oh, yes.
She thinks Vic pushed you in front of the train.
It's priceless, really.
Eh, I've got the money, Fe.
I still want us to be together, it can work, yeah? This is our chance for me, you and Kira to start over.

Freaks and punks and lost puppies.
We always had a friend in Sarah.
- You have a few words, Felix? - Huh? Anything you want to express? Oh, no, I can't, Bob, I'm too verklempt.
We're in Bummed Out City.
Plead your mercy and your pity.
Is not life a mirror maze.
To Sarah.
To Sarah.
To Sarah.
I can't figure out, why she killed herself.
It's just not Sarah.
It's not Sarah.
Well, at least she had love.
Whose love did she have? Yours? Love is imperfect.
Love is imperfection itself.
If that's your definition, no wonder she jumped.
- Shit - Whoa, whoa, take it easy! - Let him go, Vic.
- Say it.
Go ahead, say it's my fault! - Say it's my fault! - It's your fault.
Vic, be cool.
- Everyone's raw, it's okay.

My bad.
I'm not a huggy griever, Vic.
Katja Obinger.
Berlin.
Who the hell are you? Hey, what time do you open? Um, I need front and driver side window.
Vic, I'm tired.
Ah, one last drink.
A bourbon for Sarah.
Oh, Jesus! Very good.
Okay, - off you go.
- Wait a minute.
My turn.
God.
I want to get to know Sarah's daughter.
- Out, Vic! - Why not? - There's a reason you never met her.
- What is it? Well, let's see, for starters, you're a drug dealer.
I could help her financially.
And Sarah left you.
She ran because you're abusive.
- I want to make up for that.
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Felix I want to stay connected to her.
- To who? Who? - Her.
Vic, Kira is not Sarah.
Sarah's dead and she's not coming back.
You need to man up and accept that.
Felix? Hug me.
Oh, come on.
Vic, I have a knife and I will stab you in the face.
Shit.
Aren't you supposed to wait like three days before rising? - What the hell is this? - That is your wake.
It was agony.
Yeah, Vic was here.
Why did you have one? Because I was mad at you, so I decided to blow all the money from your stolen coke on it.
Felix, does Kira think I'm dead? I don't know.
Oh, you don't know.
Vic screwed everything up when he got hold of Mrs.
S somehow.
I don't know what she told Kira.
- Vic.
- Yeah.
Since you died he's even more obsessed.
He wants to meet Kira.
- No.
- No.
I know that.
Of course not.
You think we'd let that happen? Hey, what's that? Right there, it looks like Looks like blood.
Hey, whoa, what's going on? - Nothing.
- Hey! Nothing, I don't want to talk about it.
Sarah? Ah, you remember those birth certificates? - Yeah, Beth's and the two others? - Yeah, Katja and Alison.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- Well, I met the German.
- What? Is she another twin? Yeah.
- Leave it out, Felix.
Don't.
- Did she say who she was - What did she say? - I'm not getting into it I can't - I seriously cannot explain it.
- All right, fine.
Stop.
Look, I need you to tell Mrs.
S, I'm not dead.
Yeah? That it was all a mistake.
No, no way, you do it.
If I walk in there now, after 10 months, think about how hard she can make custody.
What, so I go in and I say what? Lie? Oh, my God.
Tell her it wasn't me, I don't care, just make sure Kira knows I'm fine.
Yeah? We can still get out with her.
That's my one bit of good news! - Is this evil twin's money? - Yeah, $75,000 in cash! That's enough to lose Vic, lose the twin sister weirdness, go somewhere safe with my daughter.
Is that so much to ask? Yeah.
Maybe.
- What? - Detective Arthur Bell.
What? Bastard must have followed me and nicked it.
All right.
All right, let's not go off though, okay? Hey, no Let's not Sarah! Sarah Sarah! Fuck! Fuck that! Bastard! Sarah Whoa, hey, no, not that! I'm working on that.

It's six in the morning.
You're going to call him now? Yeah, believe me, this call he's waiting for.
- Took you a while.
- What the hell are you doing? Me? I'm just following orders, Beth.
- Orders to steal from me? - Lieutenant said, "Take your rookie by the hand, walk her right through the hearing.
" Did you stop to check it before you crossed the border? Art, I'm at home.
You got it all wrong.
I never get it all wrong, - do I? - Well, it's not what you think.
Meet me at Fung's at noon.
Fung's? What the hell's Fung's? Paul? - Where were you last night? - Oh, shit! Don't do that.
I Um, I was at the station.
I was, um, catching up on this back log.
You're under suspension.
Yeah, so? They reconvened the hearing.
I have to get on top of this stuff.
First you screw me wild for the first time in months and then you don't even call me to tell me that you're out all night? And why are you suddenly dressing like a punk rock ho? Say again.
No, you know what, don't.
I'm going to ignore that.
I'm worried you're losing the plot again.
We've been here before.
No, Paul, we definitely haven't been here before.
Sorry, I've got I've got a lot of work to do.
If you want, I could take it to the station, yeah? Beth, you're not ready for this, you need to take more time.
Is that a diagnosis? 'Cause I have plenty of professional help for that.
- Hey, please? - Don't touch me! You know, I can see the shooting is killing you, - but you stopped talking to me months ago.
- Paul - I mean, what am I supposed to do? - It's my problem.
- You don't have to take this on.
- Well, I have.
And I can't keep waking up every night, checking your breathing, worried you're mixing your meds, booze, God knows what else.
So I'm going back to Cody's for a while.
Okay.
Yeah, if that's what you want.
Punk rock ho? Oh! Hi, monkey! Did you see my mum? Oh, um Sweetie - Oi oi, Mrs.
S.
- Go on upstairs, Kira love.
Uncle Felix has got some explaining to do.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Sarah's too tough to commit suicide.
Most feral mutt I ever took in.
Don't shrug.
Staging a funeral to get away from Vic.
Why would you help such a stupid plan? Vic's a dick.
Plagued that girl was, from the very start.
What do you mean by that? Tell her she hasn't seen her daughter in almost a year and I think it's best if it stays like that.
Why don't you tell her yourself, Siobhan? - I'm not going to play Felix in the middle.
- Oh, no? You're here at her beck and call, aren't you? Yes, I am.
To make sure that Kira doesn't think that her mother's dead.
And, oh good, look, she doesn't.
You and Sarah, you can work out the rest.
Years of my life.
Leaving London.
All my people there, to bring the two of you here for a fresh start.
I'd do it all again, Felix.
Every visit from the bloody police about her, every missing persons report.
Every punch we threw.
Because Kira - is a gift.
- Sarah knows that.
No.
She hasn't a clue.
She is trying.
Badly.
Granted.
But in her own way, she is, she's really trying.
Oh, ho ho! Caught ya! Come here, come here, monkey! When is Mummy coming? You know when, love.
- When she's ready.
- And? When you say she's ready.
Sounds fair to me.
Right here.
Right where I thought I saw Yip.
That's when I drew my weapon.
She What did she do? It's not a payoff, Art.
It's not.
Then cut the shit, Beth, and tell me where it came from.
It's Paul's, okay? It's Paul's and mine.
I cleaned out our joint savings account.
I haven't told him yet.
Yeah, I was going to leave town.
But I couldn't do it, okay? I turned around.
- For Paul? - To clear the shooting, Art.
I'm not dirty, I just freaked out.
Are you wearing a wire? - No.
- You never saw the Vic, before.
- No previous contact with Margaret Chen? - No! Art.
If there is another version of this story, - if that money is somehow connected - There's only one story, Art.
Walk me through it again.
So I know you won't crack under questioning.
I was by myself, I was canvassing witnesses on another case.
- Which case? - The Ramsey thing, the Sun Jewelry heist.
The Ramsey thing, Sun Jewelry heist.
- I wasn't even looking for Yip - Yip, who? Xan Yip, US racketeering warrant.
I'd seen her sheet that morning, Asian, female, 41.
And? And Right here, where I thought I saw Yip - You thought? - I did, I saw her.
I called her name, I told her to freeze.
She didn't.
She ran.
Disappeared down.
- You're making me nervous.
- Good.
Now you know how it feels.
When did you draw your weapon? I drew when I entered the courtyard here.
That's when I drew my weapon and then she disappeared down there.
I crossed her there and that's when I heard somebody behind me.
And I turned around and I fired twice.
They were both firing back.
It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.
Then what? Then I saw the phone in her hand and I called it in.
And then you showed up.
If they find out that you called me before you called it in, Beth They're gonna start to dig.
And if they dig, they find the pills.
And if they find the pills, you may crack under questioning, and tell them that I put the phone in the vic's hand to cover your tweaker ass.
I wouldn't do that, Art.
No, I've got to carry what I did.
Maggie Chen was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's it.
None of this ends up on you.
Good.
But to be sure, I'm going to hang on to that money until you're cleared.
How's that? Kira's fine, you're not dead to your daughter.
Come here.
She's knows I'm back, doesn't she? I can feel her.
- She knows, she's been asking for you.
- Mmm-hmm.
All right.
Okay, what about Mrs.
S? Don't worry about that now, okay? We'll work it out later.
Thank you.
Just take us with you when you leave again.
I promise, I promise, I promise, I will.
- Do you want a cuppa? - Yeah.
So, Art won't give me the money until I clear Beth's shooting.
What do you mean? Like, go back in front of the police board? Like, lawyers and cross-examination and stuff? Yeah.
That's the least of my worries.
That's Beth's other phone.
Is that the German? It's definitely not the German.
All right, I think it's time that you tell me what's actually going on.
Beth was investigating the twins, too.
I think whatever she found out drove her nuts and she topped herself.
What? - So do I pick up? - No! No! - I can't help myself.
- Then why even ask? Hello, this is Beth.
Finally! Where have you been? Busy, obviously.
Right, did you get the German's briefcase? No.
Why? Because I told you to.
Where is she staying, Beth? - Hello? - One sec.
Okay.
Uh, Carlsborough Hotel, room 303.
Well, go get the briefcase before they do.
I'll call back at midnight.
What's in What's in the briefcase? Who is that? Every time I think I learn something, I'm wrong.
Whoa, hold on.
Beth, Katja and Alison Hendrix.
Is that her? I don't know, Felix.
But what happened to the German? Are you seriously going there? Don't you wanna know what's in the briefcase? No! Cash? It's still a hustle, Fe.
- Can I borrow this? - No.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Mmmm.
Guten Morgen, Katja Obinger.
- Sarah - Don't worry.
You actually look kind of hot.
It's good, isn't it? Miss Obinger.
Miss Obinger! - Is that her? - Yeah.
Shit! Yeah? Hello.
Avery from the front desk.
Could we talk with you downstairs, please? Why would you go in my room? We had a noise complaint which led to a security check.
Ma'am, your room is trashed.
Rock and roll.
Rock and roll? The sink is broken.
What the heck is wrong with you? Unfortunately, we have an itemized bill.
Sink, mirror, three pillows.
$6,000? $6,437.
11, yes.
Yeah.
So, you have my card on file, yeah? Yes.
And my briefcase.
One moment.
Authorizing.
Must have been a heck of a party.
Everything appears to be in order.
We're very sorry about this.
Are you enjoying the city? It's killing me.
Danke schÃ n.
Danielle Fournier.
Katja.
Austrian.
Italian.
Danielle Fournier, France.
Alison Hendrix.
Scarborough.
You're practically local.
And punctual.
- Hello.
- Hey, did you get to the hotel? Yeah, but, uh Somebody got there first.
They ransacked her room.
Shit.
No briefcase? I didn't say that.
Did you find it or not? Hang on.
Screw it.
Hello.
- Who am I speaking to? - Beth? - Alison? - Who is this? Who is this? Beth's indisposed.
Is this Alison? Just one.
I'm a few, no family, too.
Who am I? Yeah, sorry, riddler.
It means nothing to me.
Look, Beth said to say I have the briefcase.
Do you want me to bring it to you? You stop it.
You stop it.
Hey, hey, hey! Don't hurt her.
Holy shite! A soccer mom! Okay, follow your sister.
Don't run.
Good boy.
Good boy.
There you go.
Hello.
Go.
Go, go.
Vivian, I'm gonna cut the I just want some answers.
Are you out of your mind? How dare you show your face in front of my children? How did you find me? German had your address.
I've got what you wanted.
I've got her briefcase.
Idiot.
Do you even know who you're talking to? Hmm? Where is Beth? Uh, she's dead.
What? I'm sorry, she killed herself.
No.
No.
No, she wouldn't do that.
That's impossible.
I'm I'm sorry, I saw her do it.
No, that can't be.
I can explain, okay? - My name's Sarah - I don't care who you are.
Why, Lord? Why me? I never wanted any part of this.
Do I wear a huge "kick me" sign on my back? Please, just tell me who are we to each other? Are you kidding me? I'm not doing that.
Nope, that is not my responsibility.
You need to get out of here.
Go and wait for a call.
- Hey, tell me what the - Let go.
Don't touch me! This is my neighborhood.
You wait for a call.
Oh, and hide your ugly face on the way out of here.
Bitch! Okay, oranges, guys.
Come on.
- I'll take two.
- Yeah, you take two.
- What's up, Art? - Where are you? I'm at home in the tub with a bourbon.
Can you hear me knocking? No? Because you're not home.
Okay, I'm in Scarborough.
What? Why? I had to go to Bed, Bath & Beyond, okay, nobody wants to admit that.
Look, whatever, Beth.
What the hell did you say to the shrink? She's ruling you unfit for duty.
What? Why? Yeah.
Unfit means no hearing tomorrow.
Oh, shit! It means this crap goes on and on.
And guess what? I'm keeping your money until it ends.
- I'll go see her now.
- No, no, no.
It's too late for that, Beth.
Get me another appointment, okay? Tell her it's an emergency, you're worried about me.
She's my doctor, she has to see me.
And what are you gonna say to her to change her mind? I'll figure something out.
I'm sorry.
My opinion is you're not ready for duty.
I am though.
I'm making progress, full progress.
Go on.
You know, with the guilt, um Seeing cell phone and reacting gun.
You're just parroting our last meeting back to me.
No, I'm admitting my mistake.
Dr.
Bowers, I'm acknowledging it, like you said.
Honestly, the best thing for me now is to get back to work.
Last time I saw you, you couldn't remember the shooting.
"I'm missing myself.
I glitched.
A break or something.
" I remember it just fine.
What I'm trying to do is move on.
Sorry, Beth, but considering your mental state leading up to the incident - That's behind me now - And by your own admission of blackout or psychotic break, I can't recommend you for duty.
That's not gonna work for me.
I understand, you're a cop.
But this is my job.
Can you read that back again? That, uh, I'm missing myself, I glitched.
Does that sound stoned to you? Glitch sound stoned? Uh, tweaked, gakked, spun? Alevia, superprax, draxophyl.
What is the difference between a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic, again? - Beth! - No, sorry, I've been confused.
I mean, it's very confusing.
Um Antidepressants, antianxieties, SSRIs.
Serotronax.
That one's a stimulant.
We have known each other for a while now, Beth.
Yeah, that's where you're wrong.
You have constantly tested me with your personal appeals for prescriptions.
I know.
My bad.
So, I'll just explain to the board that I shot this poor civilian after mixing up all your overlapping scrips.
Or am I making progress? All right, if everybody's here, let's see if we could do this again.
Board convenes in a fatal line-of-duty shooting, October seventh of this year.
State your name and rank for the record.
And begin.
Detective Elizabeth Childs.
You did well.
We'll have a ruling in a couple of days.
Okay.
- This is Sarah.
- Well, Sarah, this will be quick.
Good.
Since you apparently already know where I live, and I can't find a sitter, come by after 9:00 tonight.
- How about right now? - Tonight! Bring whatever you got from the German.
Go around back and go to the basement door.
Knock quietly.
Not bad, Childs.
Not bad.
I nailed it, man.
Every detail.
Yeah, they haven't ruled yet.
Please contain your excitement.
This is me excited.
Come on, Art, give me a little love here.
Yeah? Why do you have to be such a hard-ass? 'Cause it's your favorite thing about me.
Look, uh, Paul doesn't know that I took that money out of our account.
So just let me put it back before he finds out, yeah? I hang on to it till you're reinstated.
That's the deal.
There was no deal.
It was just you Looking out for you.
Partner.
Oh, my God! Ugh! You know I never would have got in if you said we were going to suburbia.
Oi, what you doing? Don't stop, someone might speak to us.
God! Christ! You know, my skin just breaks out every time I leave downtown.
Yeah.
Yeah, right there.
Look.
Acne.
I don't see acne.
Am I blushing? There's redness, it's right there.
Tiny little suburban stress zits emerging in direct proximity to bad architecture.
Look, Fe, I'm gonna have the money in a couple days.
Okay? And then, look, I'll make good with Mrs.
S, and we'll take Kira somewhere quiet, yeah? Somewhere warm.
Yeah.
Please.
So, what's in the house? - Won't be long.
- What? Oh, my God.
Who's in there? - Stay here, okay? - Is it the German? The German's dead.
She's dead! She died! Sadly, yes.
This one's an uptight soccer mom.
Whoa, hey, Sarah, you always do this to me.
I just need you to be my backup, okay? I don't do backup.
I don't even know what backup is.
- Give me half an hour.
- What am I supposed to do till then? Nothing.
Just need somebody to know where I am.
That is not comforting.
Sarah! Shit.
Close it.
Lock it.
Really? Be quiet, my kids are sleeping.
You're gonna shoot me while your kids are sleeping.
You wake them or show your face, yes, I will shoot you.
Well, I've never known a blood relation, but being your twin certainly sucks! You really have no idea, do you? Hey.
I'm Cosima.
Bloody hell! We talked on the phone.
How many of us are there? We're clones.
We're someone's experiment and they're killing us off.
Is that helpful? - Oh, my God! - What are you doing in my yard? You want answers, I want the briefcase.
Seriously, it's life or death.
What kind of a mother am I if I snatch my own daughter? You're reinstated.
Holy shit.
Yes, I'm at the bloody crime scene pretending to be a bloody cop.
So I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match.
Freeze! Police! Beth!
Okay, define orphan, Sarah.
Orphan, orphanage.
So, you don't know your birth parents? No, I was fostered out then legally adopted and I came here.
- When? - Adopted, like, eight.
Came here around 12.
Heartbreaking.
Can we get back to Beth, please? Suicide? I don't accept that.
This one's some kind of low-life grifter.
How do we know she didn't push her? Oi! I already told you, I didn't wanna be her.
I got stuck.
I was running from my own shit.
- I can only imagine.
- Alison.
I'm very sorry about Beth, okay? But she was losing it, like clinically.
She was a cop.
She had tooIs.
If she couldn't cope, then I mean Look, can you just tell me what the hell this is? - Don't tell her anything.
- Uh, short answer? No.
- How are we all related? - We're not.
Well, we are, by nature.
Um, she's referring to nurture.
Just give us the briefcase that you got from the German.
I'm not giving you shit till you give me some answers.
You don't rate answers.
- Alison - Fine, she wants in? We're clones.
We're someone's experiment and they're killing us off.
Is that helpful? Hmm? Mummy? Gemma, come here.
Who are those ladies? Just They're just mummy's friends.
Why did you get out of bed? Sorry.
I wanted to float that whole clone thing a lot softer.
Come on, Sarah Oh, shit.
You're not supposed to be parked here at night.
Um, I'm I'm waiting for someone.
Well, this is a Neighborhood Watch block, so Come on, girl.
Bitch that guards hell.
Screw it.
We are genetically identical, or whatever.
It's actually kinda cool.
Um, as far as Shit.
Shit! So Was there someone there? - Oh, my God! - Freeze! What are you doing in my yard? Don't! Do not shoot me, please! - Why are you here? - Do not shoot, please.
- Hey, Alison.
Alison.
- Okay.
- Put it down.
- Get out of the way.
He's with me.
- Okay? - Move! It's okay.
Oh, shit.
You point a gun at my brother again I will kick the living shite out of you! We need to get my shit.
What the hell were you doing here? Hey, you need this? You just broke the first rule of clone club.
What? Never tell anyone about clone club? Hi.
Uh, awkward.
I'm Cosima.
You have my number.
You want answers, I want the briefcase.
Seriously, it's life or death.
You've got to be kidding me.
Clones? They're not me.
They're not.
They're completely different people.
"Soccer mum" Sarah.
"Dreadlock science geek" Sarah.
Arguably more attractive than your "evil" Sarah.
Yeah, I was there.
Thank you.
How can it be, though? What difference does it make, Fe? Last time I checked, human cloning was illegal, let alone impossible.
Yeah, leave it out, okay? It doesn't matter.
It does matter! Dead Beth, dead German.
Those two, three other Euros, you, that's eight.
And Dreadlocks is going on about a blood sample saying it's life or death.
You can't just ignore it.
Yes, I can.
I'm just me, okay? The song remains the same.
We get the 75 grand back from Beth's partner, we get Kira, and we get as far away from all this as possible.
Am I going insane? Hey, Beth, thought you were still off.
Uh, yeah.
Just can't get enough.
Um, is Art around? Beth, what the hell's going on? Uh, yeah.
I've gotta talk to you for a couple of seconds.
Hey.
Company? Yeah.
Look, things are bad with Paul.
- Okay.
- We're dividing up our shit.
Any second he's gonna find that joint account empty.
Look, you get the cash when you're back on active duty.
That's the deal.
Childs.
- Sorry, just saying hello.
- No, you're not.
Both of you.
Bad news.
You're reinstated.
Holy shit.
Welcome back.
Well, thank God.
Buckle up, kid.
You got a 10-45.
Uh Hey.
Two seconds.
Shit.
Do you want help with that? Yeah, you mind? Rory Road and Allster, confirmed 1010-45.
Forensic on site.
So, Art, about our deal.
I'm reinstated now Hey, I'm not carrying around Just call us in.
Heading for the 10-45.
Roger.
Responder, please identify.
Uh Roger.
- Out.
- Copy.
What? Something wrong? Body's chewed up pretty bad.
What do you think? I think that some idiot didn't realize they were burying a body next to an active quarry.
Got a pretty good tire print over there.
I'd say the body wasn't in the ground more than two, maybe three days.
Hey, welcome back.
Now, this would be your industrial sausage maker.
Nice of them to lend a hand, though.
Print? They better hit 'cause, uh Reconstructing the face is gonna be tough.
Hey! Can we get the guy to open this thing up? Uh I need to, uh, make a call, yeah? One sec.
I can't talk or meet.
Just answer the question.
Oh, okay, okay.
Um Our fingerprints are close enough to flag a match, yeah.
- Why? - Beth's partner found the German.
At least part of her.
- Part of her? - Yeah.
Um, I messed up when I buried her.
They have a fingerprint, Cosima.
- Oh, wait, are you being Beth right now? - Yes.
Yes, I'm at the bloody crime scene pretending to be a bloody cop.
So I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match.
Whoa.
Okay, okay.
Don't freak out.
They need to use Interpol to find the German, which is unlikely.
But, um, if one of us had a criminal record here Do you have a criminal record? Just Petty fraud, assault, whatever.
Wasted youth, all right? If the body matches me, the cops will see a mug shot of somebody who looks like Beth.
Only, it's yours truly, and I'm already supposed to be dead.
Wow, wow.
Welcome to the trip, man.
That is not helpful.
Yeah, okay, sorry.
Just don't bolt.
Okay, don't bolt.
They can't run prints instantaneously, so we do have some time here.
How much time? Bring me the briefcase and we'll talk.
Okay? Beckwith will have an exact time of death soon, but till then, I say we ballpark two, three days, see who's missing.
And, uh, fingerprints? About a couple of days? Yeah, you know the lab.
Hopefully overnight.
Uh, look, Art, um, this shit with Paul is about to go sideways, okay? I need to get to the bank.
Let me see your weapon.
- Huh? - Come on.
Show it to me.
It's empty.
Yeah, well, we left in a hurry.
You rode with me empty.
Art, it's a 10-45 for legs.
Right, Art? Like, I mean, who am I gonna shoot? That's bullshit, Beth, for regs and your partner.
Look, if this shooting has you trigger-shy, Beth, you got No, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Just give me an hour or two to get up to speed, for Christ's sake.
You can "get up to speed" on the desk, then.
I'll work this with Deangelis.
Now, get out of here.
- Hey, Art - Look, if you ask me about that money one more time, Beth, I swear to God, it's going in the shredder.
Hey.
Don't worry, you get used to it.
Two clones? Yeah, I'm not buying that.
How many of us you need to meet, Sarah? Can I have the briefcase, please.
I want some answers first.
You know what? The answers are in the briefcase.
Let me guess, you're the smart one, you're the wild one.
Would you believe we're clones? - Bourbon, rocks.
- You got it.
So you're the scientist the German talked about.
Uh, yes.
Well, PhD student, um Uh, evolutionary developmental biology at University of Minnesota.
I'm heading back there tonight.
The German was sick.
Should I be worried about that? Well, if you give me the case, I'll know in a couple of weeks.
Do you know who shot her in the head? Okay.
So, six months ago, uh, Katja contacted Beth with this crazy story about her genetic identicals being hunted in Europe.
Hunted? Brilliant.
I know.
So, so, Beth used facial recognition software to find driver's licenses in North America.
Two matches.
- You and soccer bitch.
- Yes, right.
But who is the original? Who's created us? Who's killing us? We need to know, but we lost our cop.
So, however you managed to get into her shoes, we really need you to stay there.
Stay a cop to help you.
To help us.
Help us find out who's killing us.
How? I'm not a cop.
Beth's partner's gonna figure that out.
Being Beth is what got me into this mess in the first place.
I know, I know.
I get it, I get it.
But you can't run away from her.
Look, we are your biological imperative now.
Okay? Katja's fingerprints will match your fingerprints.
So, get to Katja's fingerprint results somehow.
I think that's our only option.
All right.
Just answer me one thing.
Anything, yes.
If we're genetically identical, do you get that little patch of dry skin between your eyebrows? That's good.
Try to keep your sense of humor.
Beth couldn't.
No cream? Booked on the range, day after tomorrow, 4:00.
The range? The gun range.
You with me or not? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what about Jane Doe? Beckwith filled a bucket with fragments from the hopper.
Couple solids so far.
Dyed red hair, like bright red.
And laying out the skull fragments she's 99% sure she found entry and exit wounds.
Shooting.
So, what about the prints? Start calling.
And keep calling while you clear that shit pile of a desk.
Hey, sorry about poaching your seat on this, eh? He's all yours.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
Detective Bell.
Yeah, well, what can you tell me about her? Jane Doe.
Hey, hey.
Shh, shh.
Uh, you You want to give me that again? Am I speaking to your partner now, too, Art? Actually, we love voice change apps, so The whole office is listening.
She was just one of a few, unfit for family.
Horse glue.
So you didn't like her very much.
How about you tell us her name? She expired at Allenside Park.
Fuck.
So, what, Stephen Hawking did it? No, no, no.
The call came to me.
"Just one of a few unfit for family.
" "Horse glue"? Shit.
Art, what else did they say? They asked if I was the lead on the "quarry body".
Listen, before we go, we'll check the desk to see who took the call.
Yeah.
Uh, you going to Allenside? Yeah.
Check the log to see if there were any shots fired down there.
Okay, look, I'll see you in a bit.
Okay? Hey Raj.
Detective.
Beth.
- Hi.
- Um, so you probably know I've been off for a while.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Uh, nightmare.
PTSD, fatal civilian shooting, enquiry, medication, the whole enchilada.
- Gum? - Uh Thanks.
So, I guess you're back, then, right? Mmm, I'm benched.
I'm trying to slip in without, you know, a ripple, but on the down low, I'm a little scattered, memory-wise.
You think you could help me with a few basics? Oh, like resetting your password? Yes, like that.
And the whole procedure for fingerprint results.
I said an hour, Childs.
- I haven't checked yet.
- They're in, though? 'Cause I got a Jane Doe with zero leads.
They're probably in my inbox.
Just hang on.
Yep, not a problem.
Childs "Results from Central" I'm helping you out.
I gotta log those.
It's all good.
Nothing, anyway.
Don't do that again, Childs.
I don't know, Art.
You think someone's jerking your chain? - Auto glass.
- Hmm.
Looks like a fast exit that way.
I don't see any casings.
Could be line of fire.
- The range.
- Hmm.
I've seen her elaborate ruses and guises before, but how do you do this? How do you fake your own demise beneath a train? Wouldn't you rather know why? I don't care to know why.
Because I saw a way to dump Vic and get out of that life.
And get away with Kira.
Take her on the run with you.
Brilliant.
New clothes and a Jaguar do not a mother make.
The other point.
I don't remember.
Buffleheads.
Barrow's goldeneye.
Just passing through.
I'll set up a visit.
But the only way you will regain custody of Kira is to show me that you can be still.
You're not her legal guardian.
Mine either, anymore.
You can visit any other approach and I will stop lying to Social Services for you.
You wouldn't do that to Kira.
No.
I'd do it to you.
Hey, someone cleared this out.
Laid down in here.
Around here? Probably homeless.
Yeah.
But someone moved this into position.
Hey, this look like a blind to you? A log for someone to lay a rifle on? Weeds knocked down for sightlines.
Where are you? Um, back at school.
What? School? What? Oh, shit, right.
Right, right, right.
Minneapolis, shit.
Uh, what's going on? Well, I managed to scrap the fingerprint results for a while anyway.
But the killer contacted Art, Cosima.
He's already at the scene where Katja was shot.
Okay, that's good.
Just Just stick with him.
I can't.
He's He's benched me because I'm bloody useless.
I need help, Cosima.
He wants me on the range tomorrow.
I've never even fired a gun.
All right.
Well, just hold tight, we know somebody who can help with that.
- You serious? - If you are.
You know we got a motorcycle tread over here, Art.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, it's a good print, could be the shooter's getaway.
Yeah, but a long gun on a motorcycle.
Could be the weapon broke down, right? Yeah, it could be.
Hey, I got something over here.
Headshot.
Bright red hair.
It has to be this morning.
Art's got me chasing down motorcycle models from tire tracks, and I'm shooting bloody targets at a gun range tomorrow.
Well, I can't just conjure a sitter out of thin air.
It's weekend prime-time, Sarah.
Well, then we're all screwed.
Aren't we? Donnie Can you watch the kids for a couple of hours today? - Golf.
- Give it.
- On television? - No, I have a tee time, remember? I'm sorry, I'm coming up empty.
I may have a solution.
Gemma, Oscar, this is Felix.
Hello.
- Brilliant.
- So, I'm going out for a couple of hours.
So you be good.
Mommy's gonna be very upset.
Okay? Same goes for you.
So, what now? Does your daddy have a drinks trolley? What's that? Don't worry, I'll find it.
You.
- You want to dress up like a little girl? - No.
Well, I don't have anything for you then.
I'll dress up like a boy.
We can work with that.
No, the make and model matched the tread that Deangelis sent you.
A sports bike Suzuki SV650.
Oh, black tank, custom pipes, and stolen when? Uh, reported four days ago.
I I should probably get back to my real job now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just put out a You know - An APB.
- Yes.
Yes, ASAP.
Um, sorry, I'm at the doctor.
My phone's about to die.
Okay.
I'll get someone to do it.
Thanks, Raj.
Well, go.
Okay, reload, try again.
So most city cops carry Glocks, but a Walther P99, it has an optional-sized handgrip.
It's good for women, Beth said.
Particularly women living their lives like rats in a lab.
Is that what you think? Well, what else could it be? Someone is covering up their illegal experiments by wiping us out.
Well, whatever it is, I need to protect my family.
So Beth taught me how to shoot.
For that I'm grateful to her.
I'm sorry you lost her.
Uh, but anything you can tell me about her will help.
Well I fail to see how someone like you can fill Beth's shoes.
Truth is I barely knew Beth.
She was all business but I admired her, she didn't cry, she was discreet, she didn't bring her foster brother to my house.
I didn't know the rules of clone club, did I? Can you not use the c-word? Please? Shit.
Stop here.
I'll walk the rest.
So my bottom line is my children can't know their mother is a freak.
Things have to stay on a need-to-know basis.
- Yeah, I'm fine with that.
- Good.
- So, we made a decision to trust you.
- Really? Sarah, this is my life now, and I'm doing the best I can.
So Beth had, um, a substantial sum, sort of a fund, she used to buy information we couldn't get officially.
Okay.
We were a cop, a scientist and myself.
The fund was how I could contribute.
- How much? -75,000.
You could rob me blind.
But we're hoping you realize you can't run away from this.
So can you con her bank or not? Good.
Oh, Gemma! Look, Mom, we're cross-dressers.
- No, you are not.
- I'm you.
Oh, you're back.
- Felix.
- Don't go! Can Felix stay the night, Mom? No.
My work here is done, I'm afraid.
- No! - Stay, Felix.
Adios, dragsters! - Wow.
Okay, so the money belongs to Alison.
- Mmm-hmm.
Well, so what're you gonna do now? Gonna rip off your new sis and abscond with Kira? She's not my sister and, yeah, that's exactly what we do.
Well - Shit.
- Hide! You cannot hide in minimalist furniture! Go.
Shit.
You're not supposed to be here.
Nice.
You were staying at Cody's for a while.
I think that's a good idea.
Well, I think you're being a bitch.
I'm the bigger person here, I need a change of clothes.
Uh, I I've been reinstated, Paul.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Well, how do you feel about that? What? Are you painting by numbers? I guess I am.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm like this, Paul.
- Uh - You're not like this, Beth, it's your job.
Yeah, but I'm a cop first, Paul, but Shit.
How would you like it if I start pulling this schizophrenic hot-and-cold crap on you? Maybe you should, Paul.
I mean, seriously, where are we going with this? Sorry.
Gotta go.
Oh, my God! Oh! She doesn't want to break up with big-dick Paul.
She smells it in her musk.
You are stuffed.
Oh, holy shit.
Oh, don't worry, I bet he's wanking already.
Oh, he'd better be.
Paul will so be.
- No, no, no, no.
- No.
Eye on the prize, okay.
Get the money back from Beth's other partner.
- Get out.
- Yeah.
Maybe it's a lady grip Walther.
You like your big Glock, don't you? So, um, two sets of tire tracks at the crime scene? One motorcycle and one car? Yeah, but there had to be three people there.
So, if the killer's on a motorcycle, then what? He has an accomplice, drives the vic to the quarry? Or the vic has a driver, doesn't go to police, panics, and half-ass buries the body? Yeah, the, um, body dump doesn't match the professional hit.
Exactly.
And I got something else for you, Beth, you're gonna love this.
That was in the sniper's nest.
Yeah.
We got a live one.
Phone calls, leaving clues, messing with us.
Resetting! Weapons down, please! Detective Childs.
All right, yeah, Suzuki? Okay, hang on a sec.
All clear! Okay, thanks.
Patrol's spotted my stolen Suzuki down at Parkdale.
It's a long shot.
We may as well see if the tires match.
Is this the stolen sport bike? Yeah, it looks like it.
Well, let's find the super.
My son? My son? Yeah, I I know, he's not home, but, um, the motorcycle, does it belong to a renter? Upstair? My son no here.
No.
No.
Thank you.
Thought you were the one supposed to deal with the non-English speaking majority.
Uh, yeah, my Ukrainian sucks.
Easy access.
Motorcycle clothes.
It's open.
What you got there? Uh "You formed my inward parts, "You knitted me together in my" "mother's womb.
"I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
" Bibles, dolls.
This perp's got some deep-seated spiritual problems.
Go! - No.
No.
- I'm okay.
Go! Go after him! Go! Shit.
Freeze! Police! Shit.
Shots fired! Foot pursuit in progress.
- Art.
- Where are you? Uh, I think he went west, uh, between the two, uh, the row houses.
Uh, I think he went into one of the abandoned buildings here.
Beth! No! Good riddance.
Elizabeth Childs.
I'm not Beth! Dirty little copy cop.
Who are you? Not yet.
Not Beth.
Beth! Beth! Jesus Christ! Are you okay? Hey.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Where'd he go? Okay.
Okay, I got you.
I got you, come on.
All I saw was a hoodie.
He hit me from behind.
And you struggled with him at close quarters? Yeah, I was almost out, I never saw his face.
Lieutenant.
I almost lost not one but two detectives.
How the hell are you in this without backup, Art? It was a thread, Lieutenant.
It was a flimsy lead on a stolen bike.
Well, it sure hit.
- You sure you're all right? - I'm fine.
Just let me take her home.
I never should have told you to go after him.
Of course I'm gonna go after him, Art.
It's not your fault.
No, no, I should have had your back.
You had mine.
I didn't have yours.
Yes, you did.
Look, shit happens fast, okay? Will you please I'm not gonna let you drive me home like an invalid, okay? I just need a shower and an early start so we can catch this guy.
- Okay? - Hey.
Your money's all there.
You did have it in the trunk.
Sorry I held it over you.
Guess I owe you one.
No, we're square.
Hey, you're not gonna hug me, are you? See you in the morning.
Are you sure about this? Yeah.
Bloody Mrs.
S.
She's right.
Really? What kind of mother am I if I snatch my own daughter? A crap one.
I agree.
And if I rob Alison? - Run now and never tell my - Clones? Oh, God, we do have to find another word for that.
Don't tell them what, Sarah? What happened? After all this? Really gonna go and just give the money back to bitchface? Mrs.
S gave me one visit.
I need to get it right.
Okay.
Well, this has taken years off my life.
Now can you please tell me what in the hell happened to your face? Detective Childs.
No, you're not.
Can you tell me what the angry angel looked like? Beth probably shot Maggie Chen on purpose.
She never told us anything about this.
We need to spend some time together.
Figure out what's suddenly going on with us.
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.
You're not my mother.
It's not about revenge.
She was here.
She was Beth.
She's gonna get us both busted unless I meet her.
Alone.
